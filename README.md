## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Danncode10/DannFlow/main/install.sh | bash
```

That's it. The installer:
1. Asks for your app name
2. Clones DannFlow into a new folder
3. Installs npm dependencies + `.env.local`
4. Installs Ruflo globally + registers its MCP server
5. Runs the Ruflo init wizard
6. Installs 8 skill packs (design, SEO, marketing, accessibility)
7. Runs `guide.sh init` to rebrand the project to your app name

**Windows?** Use WSL or Git Bash and run the same command. Or use the PowerShell version:
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex (irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Danncode10/DannFlow/main/install.ps1)"
```

## 🗺️ After Install — 5 Steps to Make It Yours

Run these **once** in Claude Code after the installer finishes:

```
1. Edit README.md          → describe YOUR project (Claude reads this first)
2. /init-claude            → rewrites CLAUDE.md + SKILLS.md to match your project
3. Fill PROJECT_CONTEXT.md → audience, stack decisions, design rules, anti-decisions
4. /ruflo-upgrade          → adds memory + parallel-agent patterns to commands
5. /no-conflict            → verify docs and code are in sync
```

Then start building:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Database setup for contributors

DannFlow keeps Supabase as the database/auth layer. Database schema is authored in TypeScript with Drizzle:

```text
db/schema/*.ts
```

Generated SQL migrations live in:

```text
db/migrations/*.sql
```

For a fresh local clone:

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env.local
pnpm db:setup
pnpm dev
```

`pnpm db:setup` starts local Supabase, applies `db/migrations/`, and regenerates `src/types/supabase.ts` from the local database. Hosted projects can use `pnpm db:types:remote` after setting `SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID` in `.env.local`.

When you change `db/schema/*.ts`:

```bash
pnpm db:generate add_profiles_table
pnpm db:migrate
```

`pnpm db:generate` writes SQL into `db/migrations/`. `pnpm db:migrate` applies those migrations to Supabase with `DATABASE_URL` and refreshes remote types.

**Want Claude to design the whole site for you?** After the 5 steps, run **`/design-project`** (⭐ on Opus) — it reads your `README` + `business.json` + `PROJECT_CONTEXT`, runs a quick design-taste interview, then designs and builds every section with real copy and a fitting theme, replacing all template placeholders. Spinning up a fresh client/business project from scratch instead? **`/new-project`** does the full Phase-1 scaffold (config + GitHub repo + `origin` repoint + Supabase tenant) before you hand off to `/design-project`.

---

## Codex Workflow

DannFlow keeps the existing `.claude/commands/` library as the command source of
truth and adds a thin `.codex/` compatibility layer for Codex.

Use Codex commands like this:

```text
/claude-command <claude-command> [arguments]
```

Examples:

```text
/claude-command ui src/components/BillingForm.tsx
/claude-command new-feature billing
/claude-command sync-upstream --commits 3
```

If you do not know which command fits, ask Codex to route it:

```text
/ask-claude-command make the pricing page responsive and review it
```

Codex will read `AGENTS.md`, load the exact matching `.claude/commands/*.md`
prompt, replace `$ARGUMENTS`, and translate Claude-only concepts such as Ruflo
memory, Claude hooks, and swarms using `.codex/context/claude-compatibility.md`.

---

## 🔗 Template Chain (Build Your Own Templates)

DannFlow is designed to be **forked into specialized templates**. Each template inherits from its parent and can sync updates back up the chain.

```
DannFlow  (core SaaS framework)
    ↓
business-template  (your reusable client template)
    ↓
restaurant-website  (a specific client project)
```

**Create a template from DannFlow:**
```bash
# 1. Clone DannFlow as a starting point
git clone https://github.com/Danncode10/DannFlow.git my-template
cd my-template

# 2. Label DannFlow as "upstream" (where updates come from)
git remote rename origin upstream

# 3. Create your own GitHub repo and set it as origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/my-template.git
git push -u origin main
```

**Already have a repo that *didn't* start from DannFlow?** Adopt it in one command:
```bash
/adopt-dannflow   # installs CI, creates the dannflow.json anchor + dev branch, then syncs
```

**Sync updates from the parent later:**
```bash
/sync-upstream   # pulls selective updates from upstream into your project
```

`/sync-upstream` only touches safe files (commands, docs, scripts) — never your app code.

### Clean by default: the `feat → dev → main` flow

Adopted projects get a branch flow that keeps `main` always shippable:

```
feat/*  →  dev  →  main
  prep      test    release
```

Every promotion runs the CI check (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), so nothing reaches `main` un-tested. `/sync-upstream` respects this — synced changes land on a `feat/sync-*` branch and open a PR into `dev`, never straight onto `main`. DannFlow itself stays on `main`-only (no `dev`) so the template is always green.

→ Full details in [docs/dannflow_docs/branching-and-sync.md](docs/dannflow_docs/branching-and-sync.md).

## 🧠 Ruflo Setup (Beta)

Ruflo gives Claude Code persistent memory, an MCP server, and swarms/hooks/agents per project.

**The installer handles this automatically.** If setting up manually:

```bash
# 1. Global install (once per machine)
npm install -g ruflo@latest
claude mcp add ruflo -- npx ruflo@latest mcp start

# 2. Per-project init (in each repo)
npx ruflo@latest init wizard
```

> ⚠️ Ruflo is pre-1.0 — APIs may shift. Always install `ruflo@latest`.

**What the wizard adds to your repo:**

| Location | Purpose | Commit? |
|---|---|---|
| `.claude-flow/config.yaml`, `agents/`, `hooks/`, `workflows/` | Ruflo project config | ✅ Yes |
| `.claude-flow/data/`, `logs/`, `sessions/`, `metrics/` | Runtime state | ❌ Gitignored |
| `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/helpers/` | Agents + skills + hook handler | ✅ Yes |
| `.claude/settings.json` | Hook wiring into Claude Code | ✅ Yes |

---

## 🎨 Skill Packs (Auto-Installed)

## 🗃️ Database Workflow (Zero-Hallucination Loop)

Never let your AI guess about your database schema. Schema changes start in `db/schema/*.ts` and flow through reviewed SQL:

```bash
# Edit schema
$EDITOR db/schema/*.ts

# Generate and review SQL
pnpm db:generate        # writes db/migrations/*.sql

# Apply to Supabase and refresh generated app types
pnpm db:migrate         # applies db/migrations/ + refreshes src/types/supabase.ts

# Before risky/destructive work
pnpm checkpoint         # snapshots live schema → supabase/backups/

# Verify before committing
/review                 # lint + typecheck + guardrail check
```

**Session starter prompt** (paste this to Claude at the start of every session):
```
Read CLAUDE.md before doing anything. For schema changes, edit
db/schema/*.ts first, generate SQL with pnpm db:generate, then apply
with pnpm db:migrate. Use Supabase MCP only to read, verify, checkpoint,
or inspect the live project.
```

## ⚡ Slash Commands

Run `./guide.sh commands` or read `.claude/commands/README.md` to see the core
DannFlow commands. The repository also includes additional command packs under
`.claude/commands/`. Key ones:

| Command | When to use |
|---|---|
| `/ask-command <intent>` | Don't know which command? This routes you. |
| `/init-claude` | Tailor CLAUDE.md + SKILLS.md to your project |
| `/make-command <name>` | Create a new slash command |
| `/adopt-dannflow` | Bootstrap a non-DannFlow repo: CI + dannflow.json + dev branch, then sync |
| `/sync-upstream` | Pull selective updates from the parent template (PRs into `dev`) |
| `/checkpoint` | Snapshot DB before risky schema changes |
| `/sync-types` | Regenerate Supabase types when needed |
| `/migrate` | Edit `db/schema/*.ts`, generate SQL, apply with `pnpm db:migrate` |
| `/new-feature <name>` | Scaffold service + page + form |
| `/review` | Pre-commit lint + typecheck + guardrail check |
| `/commit` | Stage + draft conventional commit message |
| `/rls-check` | Audit RLS policies for missing tenant filters |

### Running Claude commands from Codex

Use the Codex bridge instead of duplicating command files:

```text
/claude-command <command> [arguments]
```

For example, `/claude-command sync-upstream` loads
`.claude/commands/sync-upstream.md` and runs it under Codex with DannFlow's
agent guardrails.
